oxygen-languagetool-plugin
==========================

Prototype of a LanguageTool plugin for the Oxygen XML editor

Major limitations, as this is just a prototype:
* requires a LanguageTool server running on localhost, port 8081 (HTTP, not HTTPS)
* works in Author mode only
* requires clicking the "Check Text" button once
* supports English only

Thanks to [Oxygen XML](http://www.oxygenxml.com) for providing me with a free license.
